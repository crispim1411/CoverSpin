# CoverSpin 🔄

**CoverSpin** is a lightweight Android utility designed to manage and enable screen rotation on foldable devices (specifically tested on the Galaxy Z Flip 7)

The main goal is to allow screen orientation (Landscape/Portrait/Sensor) to work correctly on external screens (cover screens) where the native OS might impose restrictions.

## Features

- **Force Auto-Rotation**: Enables full sensor-based auto-rotation on the cover screen, allowing both portrait and landscape modes.
- **Floating Gesture Button**: A discreet on-screen button to manually toggle rotation. This button appears temporarily when you rotate your device, and can be permanently enabled or disabled in the settings.

*OBS: If you are using a Samsung device and screen rotation is not working, you may need to add **CoverSpin** to the **GoodLock** app list (often found in the MultiStar module). This allows the app to override the default system behavior.*

### Requirements

- **Device:** Flip 6 or 7
- **Permissions:** Overlay Permission & Accessibility Service.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you have a foldable device (Galaxy Z Flip, Moto Razr, etc.) and want to test or improve sensor behavior, feel free to open an Issue or Pull Request.
